<h3>
    Nate: Hello Mike! Welcome to this side-project of mine, you are my first guest. Let's start off basic. Who are you?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: Hi Nate. I am Michael Becker. I am the developer of Herakles and the Princess of Troy. I have a B.S. in Information Systems at VCU.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: That's very interesting to hear. Do you have any programs you like to make featured anywhere?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: I have made a number of programs that I have made available for free on my website at <a href="http://www.beckergames.com">www.beckergames.com</a>. The most popular one is called Internet Connection Notification. It alerts you when you internet connection goes up or down. It is useful if you do not have a stable internet connection.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: Rise up, unstable Wi-Fi gang. Are there certain things you like to do as hobbies?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: I like to workout and exercise. One of my favorite things is to go on a 2-3 hour bike ride in the park in the spring/summer. I am lucky to live just 2 miles from the biggest park in Virginia, with over 50 miles of trails. I do resistance training 3-4 times a week. I also love everything to do with computers, from building/repairing to programming.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: How often do you like to visit the park? Great scenery there?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: In the spring and summer, about once a week. It has a lot of greenery, as well as a creek to kayak and fish on. One of my favorite places to bike to within the park is a waterfall that is secluded because of the distance from the park entrance. It is very peaceful and tranquil there.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: Would love to visit it sometime in the future. How did your game, Herakles and the Princess of Troy, first originate? Were there some large changes from ideas on paper to game, or from the original version to the one today?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: In spring of 2006, I was a senior in high school. My Latin II teacher gave us a project to work on. She said we could make anything we wanted as long as it had to do with Latin/Greece. Some people made volcanoes or PowerPoint slides. But I had been teaching myself how to make games for 4 years at that point. As the teacher began to tell us about the project, I instantly knew what I wanted to make and the vision of a Greek platform game was born in my mind. I asked the teacher if it’d be okay to make a computer game and she said yes. The first night began with me just creating a test level. It consisted of the player that could move around and swing his sword, as well as the enemies moving around with their swords. It was so much fun to jump over the enemies to kill them with the sword and I became very excited. The game’s core element was fun and that was a great thing to build off of. I spent time researching different Greek stories to figure out which hero and story that I wanted to choose. I looked for a story that had plenty of conflict and combat. It took me 3 weeks to make Hercules and the Princess of Troy. I scrapped some ideas for it to meet the deadline, such as a map screen. I presented it to my class and everyone loved it. My teacher even had me show it to her other classes because she was so proud. I also posted it to the Game Maker forums. People gave it great reviews there and also offered suggestions on ways to improve it.
    </p>
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    In 2007, a user by the name of J_B suggested that I upload an empty project with just the images so that someone could improve them. I did that and J_B quickly sent me an updated version of the game with much better graphics. This is what gave me the vision of Herakles, a new and improved version of Hercules. And my vision of Herakles would improve on all of the suggestions that were made on the original Hercules game. For years, I would play around with XNA to work on Herakles. As I was in college at this time, I was constantly learning new things. I probably restarted the XNA Herakles project 3-5 times as I became a better programmer. I stopped working on it in 2011 to pursue other projects. In summer of 2013, I discovered that my original game engine that I enjoyed to use in high school, Game Maker, now offered a new version that could export to other platforms. This got me excited, knowing how much easier it’d be to make Herakles in Game Maker: Studio rather than XNA. It took me about a year to get the core of the game completed and in a playable state. But it would take me much longer to polish Herakles into a version that you see today.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: That's a fantastic story. Are the graphics that J_B produced still used today?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: Yep! Many of the block and character graphics are the ones that J_B improved. He kept the same style and shape of my original artwork, which made it even easier to implement a classic mode into my game. This mode allows players to play using the original 2006 graphics of Hercules and the Princess of Troy.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: What do you enjoy about making games?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: I like that I can take an idea in my mind and craft it to show up on the screen. I like that I can then share that game with others and they can play what was at one point, just an idea in my head. It is a great feeling to watch people play with your creation.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: Do you feel more satisfaction releasing an update and finally having it over with, or from seeing how much the people will enjoy it? Feel free to be honest. With certain patches like bug fixes, I could see how it would be better to just finally have it over with.
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: I, of course, enjoy feature updates over bug fix patches but both are essential. I just see the end result of a fully polished Herakles with all of the remaining patches that I have lined up. The end result is worth all of the hard work.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: Any news on upcoming projects that you would care to share?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: Planned patches:
    </p>
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    1. Speed Run Patch - will give in-game timer and a dedicated speed run mode/system.
    </p>
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    2. Cloud and Polish Patch - Will give Steam achievements, cloud saves and more. This will be broken up into 2 patches.
    </p>
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    3. Multilanguage Patch - Will begin to implement other languages into the game.
    </p>
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    4. Platforms Patch - Will make the game playable on Mac and Linux.
    </p>
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    In-between those patches may be small bug fix patches. And after the Steam version of the game if finished, I'll begin working on getting the game onto the Xbox One.
    </p>
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Herakles is the only project that I’m thinking about right now. I am excited that the next patch will include the speed run mode. When Herakles is closer to completion, I hope to bring the speed running community into my game and offer speed running contests. I am also excited to see Herakles on Xbox One.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: Good to hear it's your main priority.
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    What's your background?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: In the summer after my 8th grade year, I had just moved into a new house. I was bored with dial up internet and no cable TV. I googled “game maker” and guess what showed up in the results? I downloaded Game Maker and ran through the starting tutorial. I loved it and was hooked. I would go on to make a number of small games while in high school. I would share them to the Game Maker forums for feedback and reviews. I would often play games for a few months and then make games for a month. And the games I’d make would often be inspired by the game I had been playing at the time. In 11th, grade, I got into Visual Basic and would later fall in love with C# for general programming. I won a Computer Science award in 11th grade. I went to VCU for college and learned a lot more about computers and technology.
    </p>  
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: Are there any foods you favorite, and possibly some you'd like to try?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: My favorite breakfast is oatmeal. I do a ¼ cup of oats (old fashioned 100% whole grain) into a bowl. I put ½ cup of water into the bowl. I put it in the microwave at 50% power level for 5 minutes. If you do 100% power, for 2:30, it’ll boil over. After that’s done, I do a scoop of peanut butter and mix it in. Then I put a banana in there. It’s good.
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    For the drink to go with it, I do unflavored protein powder (True Nutrition brand is good) with 2 tablespoons of PBFit. I put a bit of Simply 5 chocolate syrup in the drink, too. And then put the 2% milk in and stir it all up.
    </p>
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    It’s a good healthy breakfast that all goes well together. And if you can’t tell, I like peanut butter lol.
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: And here I am, eating a bowl of cereal.
    <div id="minispaced"></div>
    Is there anything else you would like to share?
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: Yes. And this is very important. i like turtles
    </p>
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    Nate: I can't believe you said that. Very heartwarming. Well, that will conclude our talk. Enjoy your day, Mike.
    <div id="spaced"></div>
    <p class="interviewee">
    Mike: Thanks Nate
