    <h2>What is CarrotOS?</h2>
    <h4>CarrotOS is a fairly large project I pursued as a final tech project for a year of school. Every student had to create a "Passion Project", in which the students had to make a project revolving around something they wanted to learn more about or partake in, such as gardening or making a professional video. Something I've been wanting to make/learn about is an operating system. Needless to say, I knew they were very complicated, but even then I was underestimating. We had about 6 weeks to complete our passion project. I both have successfully and unsuccessfully done so. While I did do what was primarily my goal, learn more about operating systems and produce one that is barely runnable, I could only manage to create a simple boot.s file, which is a "Source Assembly" file, used for making the basics of an OS. Many, many files were deleted during the creation of this, either from switching tutorials or correcting many errors. This is why there is only a boot.s file now. I had other files such as "Kernel.asm" or "Kernel.ld", but those were scrapped. In the end, I couldn't really make an easy to boot up operating system, but still at least have the very basis. This project of mine would be much better if I didn't have so many incompatabilities. For example, certain tools wouldn't function correctly in the compilation process, so I couldn't get files like .o (what the machine can read, from my research). I wouldn't doubt that, with a few more weeks of time, I could create a working kernel and possibly an interface for my OS. However, that is a continuation for another day.</h4>
    <h2>Will this be improved in the future?</h2>
    <h4>Most likely. I plan to occassionally dabble in it, maybe even work for a full 2-3 hours on it sometimes. Having my own customizability with my own computer would be something very intriguing.</h4>
    <h2>Planned features?</h2>
    <h4>There are none at the top of my head, though I would like to prioritize visuals and performance more compared to other operating systems. I plan for it to be a mix of an operating system with good visuals such as Windows 10, and one that has good performance, such as Ubuntu.</h4>
    <h2>Was anything learned from this?</h2>
    <h4>I have learned quite a lot from this. I learned a bit more about high-level and low-level languages, but more so on how operating systems work. I spent a lot of my time understanding how all operating systems function, which I feel like may benefit me later in the future. For example, I learned about first-stage and second-stage boot loaders, memory management, and more. I also learned about how components like RAM work with low-level languages. I am now fairly familiar with most operating system vocabulary, like "kernel" and "Assembly".</h4>
